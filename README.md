Here's a brief description of the project setup and instructions to run both the client and server, suitable for a `README.md` file.

### Project Setup

This project is a basic client-server application built with **Node.js** and **React.js**. The `Client` folder contains the React frontend, while the `Server` folder holds the Node.js backend. This structure provides a foundation for developing a full-stack application.

The client-side code is a React application created with `create-react-app`. It's configured to serve the frontend user interface. The server is a simple Node.js application that listens for HTTP requests. The `server.js` file is the entry point for the backend.

### Instructions to Run

To get the project running, you'll need to start both the client and the server separately.

#### 1\. Start the Server

First, navigate to the `Server` directory and install the necessary dependencies. Then, run the server with Node.js.

```bash
cd server
npx nodemon or npm run start
```

You should see a message in your terminal indicating that the server is running on `http://127.0.0.1:3001/`.

#### 2\. Start the Client

In a new terminal window, navigate to the `Client` directory and install its dependencies. Then, start the React development server which is mariadb.

```bash
cd client
npm start
```

This will launch the client application in your default web browser, usually at `http://localhost:4003/`.

### Mobile Application

```For the Mobile Application
  npx react-native start 
  npx react-native run-android
```
